# Projects
The first  Arduino Robotics file  is based on following problem statements. 
 
1. Create Edge Detector Robot
- Use IR sensor for detecting edge.
- Controlling of motors using IR sensor input.Robot shoud detects the edge of any platform and then change its direction, so it never fall from any platform.
2.Create a fire fighter robot.
- Interfacing flame sensor to detect fire, water pump to extinguish the fire.
- As soon as the robot detects flame, it should move towards the flame and then extinguish it.
3.Create a Robotic Arm using servo motors and controlling them with the help of the Flex sensor/ Potentiometer.
- Interface Flex sensor with arduino read its analog values and calibrate it by finding the min. and max. value.
- Mapping the analog values to angles for servo motor.
- only Arm movement is required horizontal & vertical.

The Second file is based on C programming problem statements. 
1. Create a unit Conversion System - Temperature (degree C to degree F & vice versa)
2. Currency (INR to USD, INR to AED & vice-versa)
3. Number Conversion (binary to hexadecimal, binary to decimal, hexadecimal to binary, decimal to binary). 

The Third File is based on Facial Recognition using Raspberry Pi and Python. 

Face Recognition Security System using Rpi.
- Use Python modules to detect faces.
- Create a security system to detect your face and then only allow you to
access the system.

The Fourth file is based on IOT Dashboard. 

The dashboard fetches live data from sensors and display on ajax based webserver hosted on Nodemcu.

The sensors used are DHT 22( Digital Humidity Temperature) Sensor, DS18B20 Body Temperature sensor and Max30100 Pulse Oximeter to detect Heart Bear and Spo2 (Oxygen Saturation level). 
This project allows to remotely monitor patient health data received from above said sensors.

The Fifth file is  C++ programming based Registration And Login System. 

This consist of three options 1. Register 2. Login 3. Forgot Credentials
- Register the user and store data in a text or Excel file.
- Access the data from the Saved text file while loging in.
- Forgot Credentials, ask username input and match this username in the
existing username from the file and if it matches then the corresponding
password will be shown on the screen.
